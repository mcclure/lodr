Lodr is a hot-loader for [lovr](https://lovr.org/). It restarts Lovr with updated code without Lovr itself having to quit and reopen.

# How to use

## On Oculus Quest

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/mcclure/lodr/releases) for Lodr and download the newest `org.lovr.hotswap` APK. This has Lodr prebuilt in it.

You will need your Quest in [developer mode](https://learn.adafruit.com/sideloading-on-oculus-quest/enable-developer-mode). You will also need the `adb` command line tool. For example, on Macintosh, you can get `adb` by installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and running `brew cask install android-platform-tools`; or, you can install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), install "Android SDK Platform-Tools" during the first-run setup, and then run `export PATH="~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH"` in your Terminal.app window before running the following commands. On Windows, to run adb, you can run [these instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/125769/how-to-install-and-use-abd-the-android-debug-bridge-utility/) (but you will also need to install the special [Quest ADB driver for Windows](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/)).

After downloading `org.lovr.hotswap.apk`, run:

    adb install -r build/lovr.apk

You only have to do this once.

Now, whenever you have new software to upload, `cd` to the directory containing your files and run:

    adb push --sync . /sdcard/Android/data/org.lovr.hotswap/files/.lodr

You can run this while Lodr is running.

If your program contains print statements, you can view them with:

    adb logcat | grep -i lovr

## On a desktop computer

Clone or download this repo. Stick the lovr-lodr directory in your command line after the executable name.

If `lovr.exe` is the LÃ–VR command line on your system and `your-game` is your project directory, run

    lovr.exe lovr-lodr your-game

If files change in `your-game` while it is running, lodr will automatically relaunch it.

# Configuration options

Lodr checks for a "lodr" table in the configuration table from conf.lua. You can set options like:

    function lovr.conf(t)
        t.lodr = {
            checksPerFrame = 1   -- How many files maximum lovr checks for changes every frame (default 10)
            watch = {"main.lua"} -- Watch only these files (by default watches every file in directory tree)
        }
    end
