Lodr is a loader for [lovr](https://lovr.org/).

# How to use

Clone or download this repo. Stick the lovr-lodr directory in your command line after the executable name.

If `lovr.exe` is the LÃ–VR command line on your system and `your-game` is your project directory, run

    lovr.exe lovr-lodr your-game

If files change in `your-game` while it is running, lodr will automatically relaunch it.

## Configuration options

Lodr checks for a "lodr" table in the configuration table from conf.lua. You can set options like:

    function lovr.conf(t)
        t.lodr = {
            checksPerFrame = 1   -- How many files lovr checks for changes every frame (default 10)
            watch = {"main.lua"} -- Watch only these files (by default watches every file in directory tree)
        }
    end
